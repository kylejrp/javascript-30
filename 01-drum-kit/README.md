# Drum Kit ([Demo](https://kylejrp-drumkit.netlify.app/))
 Day 1 of 30 of [Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 course](https://javascript30.com/). The requirements were to build a drum kit so that when a keyboard key is pressed, it would both play a corresponding `audio` element and scale/color the appropriate indicator on the screen. 

 I added touchscreen support and styled mine to look like the Rock Band 4 drum lane. I used some 3D perspective built into CSS transforms as well as some drop shadows for the glow.
 
 I only used the provided [starter HTML](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/blob/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/index-START.html) and the first couple minutes of the video that explained the requirements.
